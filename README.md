## Wordpress bedrock example

This is a very basic wordpress bedrock environment.
It also includes a:
- Basic child theme
- A base for a custom plugin
- Advanced custom field plugin that is installed using composer.

This basic setup was made in about an hour.

I wil be adding more advanced Features in the comming days;

This project is for demonstration purposes only.
